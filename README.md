CS320 Database Project
Author: Matthew D. Brenner
Author: Alexander R. Cavaliere

A simple database implementation created for CS320 based off of customer requirements as set by the professor.
The database is created and tested via java through CRUD. Usage will require an active RIT CS Postgres Account.
This project is rough around the edges due to the limited time to alloted to its creation (2 days) but it is functional.
